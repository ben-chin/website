Hello again

As I promised, I am going to disclose some of DoCSoc plans this year.

<strong>We have 2 primary goals for this year: </strong>
<ul>
	<li>Become more structured and transparent</li>
	<li>Make awesome events and bring more value for students</li>
</ul>
In the end, to determine how well we did we going to use these goal as our criteria.

<strong>We planning to achieve them working in 3 areas of activity:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Organizing events
<ol>
	<li>Socials e.g. <a title="Deutsche Bank Bar Night" href="http://www.docsoc.co.uk/?ai1ec_event=deutsche-bank-bar-night&amp;instance_id=" target="_blank">bar nights</a> – things that help you get your mind out of studies</li>
	<li>Industry - Make you more visible to companies via <a title="ICHack" href="http://ichackathon.com" target="_blank">Hackathons</a>, competitions and networking</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>Running projects
<ol>
	<li><a title="Imperial DoC on Github" href="http://imperial-doc.github.com/" target="_blank">Git repositories</a> – So you can seek inspiration in projects done by your peers</li>
	<li><a title="GameDev on Facebook" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/185348224901467" target="_blank">GameDev</a> – Games are awesome, not just to play but to create as well!</li>
	<li>Some others that I do not want to disclose for now, but they are awesome!</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>Educational part
<ol>
	<li>DoC students will be running some experimental lectures from other students to educate them in different fields, last year we had lectures on network security (aka hacking) and php, hopefully we will have something interesting this year as well.</li>
	<li>Workshops: DoCSoc is a part of <a title="ICStartup" href="http://www.icstartup.com/" target="_blank">ICstartup</a>, so if you feel that Entrepreneurship is something that you like, you are more than welcome to get involved</li>
	<li>Getting an internship is quite important, it gives you valuable experience and also money. We will be working to educate students in the best ways of going about doing this.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<strong>Action:</strong>

What do we want from you?
<ul>
	<li>Have fun – if you are not enjoying our events, if you are not learning anything new – we are not doing our job right.</li>
	<li>Attend industry talks, it will give you something to speak about on interviews.</li>
	<li>Get involved – the best way to learn something is by doing, so regardless of your experience you will find something to your level and skills.</li>
	<li>Give us your feedback and ideas – we are learning on the go. We also have our studies, courseworks, placements, but we are willing to learn and to do that we need the most honest <strong>feedback</strong> from you. Drop us an email or just talk to us in labs.</li>
</ul>
<strong>How we going to communicate:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>The main source of information is going to be <strong>weekly digests</strong> from DoCSoc about things that we think important for you. Please DO read them. We are planning to DECREASE amount of emails of DoCSoc so you don’t get annoyed. But if we send an email it’s really important, so my personal appeal, please make separate folder for DoCSoc</li>
	<li><strong>Facebook</strong>! Yes we are social!
<ul>
	<li>Go now to out Facebook page <a title="ICDoCSoc" href="http://facebook.com/ICDoCSoc" target="_blank">facebook.com/ICDoCSoc</a> and like us.  There we are going to post all information and events</li>
