Despite very short notice, we had quite good turnout. This was the first event of it’s kind for the department and fulfills DoCSoc strategy of experience sharing among Imperial peers.

Students that had just experienced internships/placement in major tech companies and investment banks shared their thoughts with other DoC students on a variety of topics.
<ul>
	<li>Bank or Tech company?</li>
	<li>What to write in CV?</li>
	<li>Where food is free?</li>
	<li>The most difficult question on the interview?</li>
</ul>
All those questions (and many more) were answered.

<strong>Format</strong> of this event was also new – discussion panel, where each participant expressed their point of view, adding new details, or arguing one with another.
