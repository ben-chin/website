Maybe not many of you know buy since this year DoCSoc has Gamedev branch!

<strong>Wtf? </strong>

Last year group of DoC students expressed that it would be cool to do Gamedev in Imperial. This topic is not fully covered by the curriculum and yet we do not have many Games out there from Imperial.

You wanted it – We made it.

"Currently we have Jose who is Gamedev officer in DoCSoc. I cannot say about the future of this stream, where it is going and whether it will be transforming in full society or will exists as branch of DoCSoc. For now I don’t see a reason to split.." - Andrey Antjufejevs

<strong>Gamedev Snake competition:</strong>

Without any further ado, gamedev officer – Jose organized 3 weeks snake challenge – build any snake with any rules, use whatever you want.

In the end on 12nd of December Andrey and Jose organized a showcase and judging.

3 snake games were presented in various implementations:
<ol>
	<li>JavaScript snake, that eats links on selected web-page</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/gds12/AnalogueSnake" target="_blank">AnalogueSnake</a> where you have to circle around you target build in Java</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/ICMediaLab/SnakeShed" target="_blank">SnakeShed</a> - Tower-defense like snake built on XNA</li>
</ol>
Each submission were assessed on 4 criteria: Bug free, Game Play, Entertainment and Creativity

The Java built snake won the competition. And George Steed got grand prize of this competition Xbox controller which he will use not only to play but to create new awesome games. Congratulations!
