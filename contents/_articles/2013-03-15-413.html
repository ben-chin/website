  <p>Talks were given by Bertrand Lamarque one of the developers for SimCity and Xavier Louis (Ex Playfish Product Management)
  They together gave us a very interesting lecture about Game as a service. Also what they think would be the ideal makeup for a game development team.
  You have view slides <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/bertrandlamarque3">here</a></p>


  <p>The second talk was about the company brainbow games. Their <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id539359333" target="_blank">past products</a> and their current work in progress. Their talk culminated with a Q &amp; A session where they talked about their experiences in the industry and also some of the setbacks of recent launches and what they thought some of the games lacked.</p>


  <p>They are also looking for interns, to get more information check their <a href="http://www.brainbowgames.com/jobs/">website</a>
  We will continue working closely with Brainbow game to give you more of such events before the end of the year.</p>
