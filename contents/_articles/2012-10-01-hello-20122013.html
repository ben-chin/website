Hey Guys today we gave you an intro to our society
First I want to congratulate everyone how made to Imperial and chose Computing! I personally know that doing this was the best decision I have made in my life so far.

<strong>So what is DoCSoc ?</strong>
DoCSoc stands for Department of Computing Society. In everyday’s life we call it DoCSoc but for everyone outside DoC, you may find it easier to call it the “Computing Society”. It is run by Computing Students for Computing students.
We are all passionate about programming, computers, technology and most importantly fun! We do everything to make life in DoC as fun as possible. We work closely with department of computing to organize social and networking events. We help you get to know each other and industry you going to work in.
<a href="http://www.docsoc.co.uk/?page_id=172"><strong>Sponsors</strong></a>
We cannot do all this alone, so we have organised several sponsors for 2012/2013:
<ul>
	<li>Deutsche Bank – an old and beloved friend of the society. I cannot count how many Imperial Graduates ended up in Deutsche Bank, and there is a reason for that. DB is awesome place to work, they support innovation and creativity.</li>
	<li>Amazon - a newcomer to DoCSoc. A leader in Cloud Services, a large percentage of websites you use everyday are based in Amazon’s datacenters. Last year was the first year Amazon recruited students outside US and only Imperial students were recruited. We value such trust and believe that this is great start for our collaboration in future. You can find IC students that had an amazing internship in US and are willing to share their experience.</li>
	<li>Credit Suisse – another favorite of Imperial Graduates in financial sector. Each autumn Credit Suisse engineers give C++ master class to 2nd year student. By joining Credit Suisse, you will learn a lot about how technology strives financial markets, big data, working in a big firm will boost give you ability to enhance your leadership skills and it will give you a great start in your career.</li>
	<li>GResearch – Is also old friend of DoC, they are quite keen on organizing competitions for first years and giving prizes for 2nd year projects. In GResearch, they promote high standards of software development and getting into GResearch is not an easy task, not that it stops Imperial Students doing so.</li>
</ul>
