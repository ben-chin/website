Fancy watching movies? - Well ... a lot of computing students do. So we decided to make a trip to one of the biggest movie effect studios in the world, which is located in the heart of London.

Almost 30 people attended this event and since we were shown “pretios” information for the company we were asked to sign a non disclosure agreement. So we can't tell you much, but we can assure you that DNEG has a crazy office. They have their own cinema and they are currently working on amazing projects. We were lucky enough to be given some information about the blockbusters that will appear this summer and show us how video effects are integrated in movies. So it was a really interesting event. :)
