<strong>What is Buddies scheme?</strong>

The buddies scheme is a union initiative run by all Departments.  For new students, this is a great way to get settled in the department, as both of your ‘parents’ will have been through it all before!

For existing students, it is chance to give something back.

All families have been matched according to interests, so your ‘family’ should have something in common.

<strong>What should you do about it?</strong>

In the beginning of the term if you are fresher you been assigned to some “Mom and Dad” you can find out who by asking your department representative

We cannot force you to interact you with your parents, but they are here to help! You can just drop them email asking to meet in labs and see what are they doing

If you don't know who is your parent email Tom Wilshere for information

<strong>Introductory event:</strong>

On 8<sup>th</sup> of October DoC &amp; DoCSoc organized an introductory lunch event for Parents meeting their Fresher’s in Hux 344. We hope that you had an opportunity to chat and had a great time.
